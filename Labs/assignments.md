# Object Oriented Programming Assignments 2014/2015

## Assignment 2

See the [github project for assignment 2](https://github.com/skooter500/Assignment2StarterCode).

## Assignment 1
Use the skills you are learning on the course to create a version of this game in Processing:

[![Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/DXlPvvmSogU/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXlPvvmSogU)

Your game must include the following features:
- A splash screen, game screen and game over screen
- Player left and right movement
- Black blocks that fall from the top of the screen. If the player collides with one of the black blocks, they will loose a life. These should have random x positions. Ideally these should be evenly spaced
- When the number of lives goes to 0, it is game over.
- Random red blocks. If the player collides with one of these, they should gain a point.
- The game should speed up hence becoming more difficult as it goes on.

You should use the following features of Processing
- Variables, arrays
- Classes
- Loops
- Drawing primitives
- The if statement
- User input

Marking scheme:
- 50% of the marks for this assignment are for implementing the core game as presented in the video
- To get the remaining 50% of the marks you have to come up with your own additions to te core game. Some suggestions:
	- Power up blocks that speed up or slow down the gameplay
	- Extra life blocks
	- Additional gameplay. For example, the ability to shoot blocks
	- Sprites and nice graphics and sound
	- Running on an Android Phone or Raspberry Pi
	- Control with a Kinect, XBOX Controller or Leap Motion
	- Different types of block behaviours instead of just falling 
	- Any other crazy ideas you can come up with your self

Rules!

- As much as possible this project should be 100% your own code. You will not get any marks for any code that include that you get from books or from the internet. This assignment is about testing what *you* have learned and what *you* can do.
- Any suspected plagorism will be dealt with according to DIT General Assessment Regulations. This could mean expulsion from DIT. I will personally grade all assignments.
- There will be a feedback session after the assignment where you will have the opportunity to get individual feedback on your submissiona and have your mark explained to you.
- All assignments should be submitted through Google Classroom. Go to http://classroom.google.com and register using the code: codymp
- The date for submission is Tuesday 4 November @ 4pm. 
- All assignment submissions must be demoed in the lab that week.
- If you need to submit an assignment late, you must submit a PC/1 form to the exams office.
